Remove all Tiktok Reposts automatically.



Get Started

First of all, download the appropiate ChromeDriver for your chrome version (chrome://version) and save it into a folder.
Change the path in the program to the ChromeDriver Location
in chrome://version, you`ll also need to copy the Profile Path with a logged in Tiktok Account, and then change it in the Python File too.
This does work for sometime, but at some time you will get ratelimited. I did not find a solution to bypass that yet, only than changing the VPNs every few minutes...
Maybe a automatic Proxy Switcher or something, i will keep this updated when i will find a Solution.

Note:
This code was not coded by me, was a simple idea and converted to code by CHATGPT.


















Thanks for using this tool.
